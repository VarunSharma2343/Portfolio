									<h1>Loremvia</h1>
									<p>During my Junior year of high school we worked on a project in which we had to 3D model a city to import into unity where we would program a VR rig to allow
										us to walk around the city. It was a duo group project in which I worked with a close friend of mine. For the project I had worked on creating the residential area of the cityc and programming the vr rig to
										allow us to walk around</p>

									<div class="box"><p><span class="image right"><img style="border:5px solid rgb(105,99,99);" src="images/IMG-3506.jpg" width="200" height="300" alt="" /></span>First we started to look for sources of inspiration. 
										We took inspiration from literature, movies, and games. On the right is a map of the city of London from the game "Fallen London", it was a main sourceof inspiration along
										with the "Last City" from the "Maze Runner" series and various different cities from the "Star Wars" universe</p>

												<p><span class="image right"><img style="border:5px solid rgb(105,99,99);" src="images/Annotation.png" width="200" height="300" alt="" /></span>
													This is one of my first intial sketches of residential area of the city. I drew this taking inspiration from the game "Fallen London", 
													having the city be located underground since our intial idea was to have a city that would have half of it above ground and the other half below.

											<p><span class="image left"><img style="border: 5px solid rgb(105,99,99);"src="images/brokenhouse.jpg" alt="gehrhjgergebrhgjersbhgse" /></span>
											The idea we had was having a physical divide between two areas of the city that served as a physical representation of class divide, we decided on that divide being a wall between the two areas. 
											This house was an earlier model that would exist in the more residential area..</p>
											<p><span class="image right"><img style="border: 5px solid rgb(105,99,99);"src="images/3buildings.jpg" alt="" /></span>
												This is one of my models involving multiple buildings. After making a few individual models I put them together on mimic grid system to give a general idea of
												what we would see in the actual city.</p>

											<p><span class="image left"><img style="border: 5px solid rgb(105,99,99);" src="images/Ambientoclusion_JohnHuhn.jpg" alt="render"></span>
											This is an ambient occlusion rendering of our city after we were done with laying down the foundation of it and merging both halfs together. We realized that there was 
											still a lot of work left for us to do seeing how we needed to add more details and creating the actual wall. I realized that some of buildings lacked detail in them
											and so I decided to work on detailling the buildings instead of creating less detailed models. One major issue was that we had not really discussed the scale of the city and so parts of the city were not properly scaled with each other </p>
											<p><p><span class="image right"><img style="border: 5px solid rgb(105,99,99);" src="images/Unityview4_Johnvarun (3).JPG" alt="render"></span>
											After we spent a while creating small details and fixing some of the individual models we finished up the final version of our city that we
											were pretty happy with. </p>
