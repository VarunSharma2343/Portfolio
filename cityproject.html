									<h1>Loremvia</h1>
									<p>During my Junior we had a project in which we had to 3D model a city before importing it to unity and programming a VR rig to allow
										us to walk around the city.It was 2 man project consisiting of me and my friend. I worked on the creating the lower class part of the city and programming the vr rig to
										allow us to walk around</p>

									<div class="box"><p><span class="image right"><img style="border:5px solid rgb(105,99,99);" src="images/IMG-3506.jpg" width="200" height="300" alt="" /></span>Firstly we started to look for sources of inspiration for our city. 
										Looking at literature, movies, games etc. On the right is a map of the city of London from the game "Fallen London", it was one of our main sources of inspiration along
										with the "Last City" from the "Maze Runner" series and various different cities from the "Star Wars" universe</p>

												<p><span class="image right"><img style="border:5px solid rgb(105,99,99);" src="images/Annotation.png" width="200" height="300" alt="" /></span>
													This is one of my first intial sketches of my part of the city . I drew this taking inspiration from many sources mainly "Fallen London". 
													I had drawn this city underground since our intial idea was to have a city that would have half of it above ground and the other half below. 
													The main theme for our city was a social divide between the upper and lower class. Where we would have the upper class reside above and the lower class below.</p>

											<p><span class="image left"><img style="border: 5px solid rgb(105,99,99);"src="images/brokenhouse.jpg" alt="gehrhjgergebrhgjersbhgse" /></span>
											we decided on going for both a "ghetto like" and modern city. The idea was having a physical divide between the two classes, a wall. 
											I was in charge of the lower class area and this house was an earlier model of a house that would exist in said area..</p>
											<p><span class="image right"><img style="border: 5px solid rgb(105,99,99);"src="images/3buildings.jpg" alt="" /></span>
												This is one of my models involving multiple buildings. After making a few individual models I put them together on mimic grid system give a general idea of
												what we would see in the actual city.</p>

											<p><span class="image left"><img style="border: 5px solid rgb(105,99,99);" src="images/Ambientoclusion_JohnHuhn.jpg" alt="render"></span>
											this is an ambient oclusion rendering of our city after we were done with laying down the foundation of it and inserting both halfs of it together. We realized that there was 
											still a lot of work left for us to do seeing how we needed to add more details to it and creating the wall that we had talked about. I realized that some of buildings lacked detail in them
											and so I decided to work on detailling the buildings instead of creating less detailed models. </p>
											<p><p><span class="image right"><img style="border: 5px solid rgb(105,99,99);" src="images/Unityview4_Johnvarun (3).JPG" alt="render"></span>
											After we spend a while creating small details and fixing some of the individual models we finished up the final version of our city that we
											were pretty happy with.</p>
