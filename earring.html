									<h1>Cascading Flakes</h1>
									<p>The project that introduced me into the world of 3D modeling and design.</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img img style="border:5px solid rgb(105,99,99);"src="images/earringboard.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>This was my first ever project invovling 3D modeling and design. The premise of the project was to create 
									marketable earrings for the christman pop up shop that we host</p>
									<div class="box"><p><span class="image left"><img style="border:5px solid rgb(105,99,99);" src="images/earing2.JPG"  alt="" /></span>I had started with some 
									intial sketches  using the season of fall as inspiration and others being drawn using different shapes and inspirations. Ultimately I decided on my design.
									I chose my design which involved multiple shapes being interjoined, with a leaf attachment for the fall spirit</p>

										<div class="fields">
											<p><span class="image right"><img style="border:5px solid rgb(105,99,99);" src="images/earringmodel.jpg" alt="" /></span>
												This is my first model of my desgin which was made using onshape. I got rid of the leaf like shape at the end of the earring
												mainly because it felt out of place among the shapes being used. I felt that it wouldnt really fit the basic shape theme
												. I also made the earring hole in the rectangle so the prototype can be immediately
												worn and tested</p>

													After my first 3D model I realized that the rectangle, didnt work and seemed out of place.
													I tried offsetting the rectangle to make some empty space in the middle just like how i did with the other shapes, but it didnt work
													for a few reasons. I would have to offset the rectangle a very specific amount so it wouldnt disrupt the earring hole, and like I said before it just didnt 
													fit in the overall look. I made this model thinner than the previous, since the prototype came out a little too thick. I also made it so that the triangle and the
													diamond shape were not just connected to the circle at some point but piercing it. And I moved the earring hole to the top of the triangle</p>
													<div class="col-2"><p><span class="image fit"><img style="border:5px solid rgb(105,99,99);" src="images/VARUN_EARRING Drawing 1.jpg" alt="" /></span>
													Above is a titlesheet of the 3D model with its dimensions. I decided that this would be my final design and I would start to work on producing the protoypes
													for testing</p></div>

											The prototype came out fine for the most part except for one thing, that being it was a little too thin. You can see how the top triangle has 
											a gap at the bottom of it due to the thickness being too little. This was the only issue with the prototype which was then later on fixed and 
											the earrings were finalized</p>
