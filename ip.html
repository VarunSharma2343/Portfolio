                                    <h3>"CyberPunk Keychain"</h3>Not too long ago a show called "Cyberpunk Edgerunners" came out. It quickly became one a favorite of mine and I fell in love
                                    with the art design of the show. The main character has a logo that he wears on his back, and i decided to make a keychain of the logo because I loved
                                    the logo. </p></span>

                                    <h3>Phone Case 2.0 (WIP)</h3><p>I made my original phone case back in my sopohmore year of high school, but I now feel that with the skills that I have learned now I can do a much better job
                                        than what I had done in my sopohmore year. This time I plan on creating a design that focuses on negative and positive spaces.

                                    <h3>Darth Vader Lightsaber replica </h3>In my junior year I decided to try out the 3D modeling software, Blender. So I decided to make something simple and not too hard, I chose to make a model of Darth Vader's lightsaber. It was mainly because I am huge fan of Star Wars
					and wanted to make something that is close to me. I made the base model for the hilt but did not add materials to it yet.
                                    </span></p>

                                    <h3>Wood Portfolio Book</h3>In my Junior year I had joined an after school course called MakerLab. In this class we worked on creating portfolio books from wood for ourselves.
                                    We first started with coming up with our design for the front cover. We each had to take inspiration from nature and I chose a close up image of a leaf. Afterwards 
                                    we traced over our sketches with micron markers, we imported a picture onto Illustrator to fix any line issues (basically any lines that were not connected and were going nowhere were causing issues in what the cutter deems should be lazered) in the sketch. After fixing the sketches in Illustrator 
                                    we got to laser cutting. Below is the nature pattern I chose and my sketch.
                                    I chose to actually etch my design onto the wood instead of cutting it because I felt that would be better for my design.</span></p>

                                    <h3>Star Wars Cantina Bar (WIP)</h3> Another project of mine, a star wars cantina bar. There is still some more to it that I have to complete before I can say
                                    its finished. Below is a screenshot of the 3D model itself and the reference image I used.</span></p>

                                    <h3>Wood Portfolio Book V2</h3>This was my most recent project for my IDA class. The project required us to either create a portfolio book or a box with our designs cut from wood.
                                    I chose to make another portfolio book as i felt that i could come up with a much better design than my previous one. My design took inspiration from a city grid system with each grid  
                                    representing a building or other structure. I had printed two layers of my design the first layer was the initial design and the second layer was an offset of the first layer
                                    .I then glued the two layers together and ended up with my final product.</span></p>

                                    <h3>Second Custom Built Computer</h3>Last year I decided to build a second computer, this time for my dad who's pc had started to age and slow down. I figured that since I
                                    already built one for myself I can do one for him too. Since he mainly uses his pc for checking emails, browsing the web etc I figured that I wouldnt need to
                                    buy expensive and more modern parts. So I went with: 
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Ryzen 3 with intergrated graphics</li>
                                        <li>Msi Bazooka micro atx motherboard</li>
                                        <li>500W psu</li>
                                        <li>500gb nvme ssd and a 1tb HDD</li>
                                        <li>8gb ram</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    </span></p>
                                </div>
                                <div class="box"><p><span class="image right"><img style="border:5px solid rgb(105,99,99);" src="images/pc1.png"/>
                                    <h3>First Custom Built Computer</h3>Towards the middle of freshman year of high school my school went full virtual. The only device that I had at the time to use for school was the school issued chromebook, which 
                                        had a lot of problems. I was able to stand it for a few months before I hit a breaking point and decided that I needed something better. I thought about maybe getting a new laptop
                                        but I figured that I at least have the chromebook for portability, even though its not the best. For some time the idea of building a pc had been stuck in my head and I realized that now was the time.
                                        After hours and days of researching and ordering parts and then spending a whole day assembling it, the pc was complete. This was one of the most important
                                        projects for me and a very personal one too that I look back at often. For the parts I went with:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Ryzen 5 CPU</li>
                                            <li>B450 DS3H micro atx motherboard</li>
                                            <li>rx 570 gpu</li>
                                            <li>600W psu</li>
                                            <li>1 tb hdd and 500gb ssd</li>
                                            <li>16gb ram</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        </span></p>
                                </div>
